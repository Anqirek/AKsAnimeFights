## What does it do?

This website allows you to veiw details about anime OP characters so that you can find out more information regarding each character. You will also be able to add your own OP character so that others can learn more about them.

## Why did we do it?


We elected to go with OP Anime as we were all fans of Anime and enjoy the fights that they are often placed in. This is most apparent in the styling and design of the webpage layout.

## Technologies and Languages Used

For this project, we used a plethora of technologies to bring together the whole package. The techonology stack used for this project was:

- `JavaScript`
   - Allowed for setting the `onOnclick` and `submit` on the page, and brought actual functionality and interactivity to the project. This is also how we were able to make our request to the local server to both render current creatures and also add/update OP Characters within the database. Using JS, we achieved certain milestones of the CRUD method.

- `HTML`
   - Allowed us to set the basic skeleton of the page. This is also where we set the body of the form to allow for OP Charcter submissions. Having a clean, concise layout at this stage sets the foundation for the rest of the project and how it will allow flow for the user.

- `CSS` 
   - This is how we set the theme and feel for the enitre page. Using CSS, we could link an amazing backround as well as set the style and image for the cards that each creature is rendered on. `CSS` also allowed us to select and set the fonts seen through the entire page. In a extremely boiled down statement: `CSS` allowed us to set the "feel" for the enitre page and project

- `Json Server`
   - Using `Json Server` allowed us to locally create and run a database. Every creature is added as an object, and then renders down into its own "card" via the GET request. As long as the server is running, every creature present will render and populate on the page.

- `Markdown`
   - This technology is how we were able to create this `README.md`! Using the baked in syntax within `Markdown`, we styled and formatted the layout and information to present it in a clean and thoughtful way. The syntax used within were: `Headings`, `Horizontal Rule`, `Unordered List`, `Bold` and `Code`.
   - `React`
    -Using react dom routes we were able to keep our code clean and orginzed as we worked through the process.

## Conclusion

As a whole, this project was a great introduction to what can be expected as we move forward in our professional careers and start working on different projects and repos. It also provided valuable, personal insights to:

- Project Design

- Project Layout

- Time Management

- Conflict Resolution

- Teamwork

- Collaboration

- Troubleshooting

- Project Daily Goals

- Self lead Stand Ups and Stand Downs

- Community

These lessons and concepts form the foundation of everything that is to come in out Software Engineering journey. As time goes on, we will continue to strgenthen and reinforce this foundation, and build upon it new skills and techonologies to achieve even more ambitious goals.
